# lfpscrape.py
Small tool to scrape a webpage for local file paths

## Usage
python lfpscrape.py (URI)

## Notes
I put this together to help whilst bug bounty hunting and thought it may be useful for others.

THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

## TODO
* Ignore known strings that are not file paths
* Make conditions use regex (urghhhh)
